## Visualizing, extracting, and analyzing 1D spectra.
This is my personal workspace for analyzing spectroscopic data that I have accumulated. Notice that there is a private repository (called "spectral-secrets") where I store the proprietary info that I use in this repository.

If a script I am working on requires more security before it's completed (i.e., has proprietary information in it during construction) I'll be working on it in my spectral-secrets private repository -- then will move it to this public repository once finished.
